# 👨‍💻 About the Developer

## Personal Introduction
I'm Umut, a 27-year-old developer specializing in Python and PHP. While I used to be an avid gamer, my responsibilities as a family provider have shifted my priorities, leaving limited time for gaming.

## 🤖 Bot's Journey
White of Survival bot started as a fun project for my own alliance. Upon realizing there wasn't anything similar available, I decided to develop it further and share it with the community. You're currently experiencing Version 4, following successful releases of V1, V2, and V3.

The development process has been intense, ranging from 1-2 hours some days to marathon 14-15 hour coding sessions.

## 💭 Why Free?
I'm often asked why I keep this bot free. The answer is simple: accessibility. If monetized, the user base would shrink from thousands to perhaps just 10-15 users. Having experienced financial constraints myself, I understand the importance of making useful tools available to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.

## 🤝 Support & Development
For those who can and wish to support the project, you can use the [☕ Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/reloisback) link. These contributions help cover development costs:
- Proxy servers
- Testing environments
- Server maintenance
- Development tools

## 💝 Final Words
To those unable to provide financial support - thank you for using the bot! Support has never been and will never be mandatory. This project will remain free forever.

I love this community and thank you all for being part of this journey. ❤️
