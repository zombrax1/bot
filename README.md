# Applying the CAPTCHA Solver Patch

This guide explains how to manually update your existing bot installation to include the new automatic CAPTCHA solving feature for gift code redemption.

Please note that until Relo is able to pull the code into the main repository, or provides a fix of his own, this patch will require manual installation.

**IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding, it is crucial to back up your bot's data to prevent loss in case anything goes wrong.

## ⚠️ Important Note: OCR Requirements (EasyOCR)

This patch uses EasyOCR (which depends on PyTorch) for captcha solving. EasyOCR is **resource-intensive** and requires:

- **5GB+ of disk space**
- **Modern CPU** with AVX / AVX2 instruction set support
- Optional: **GPU** with CUDA support for faster OCR

If your CPU does not support AVX instructions, PyTorch will fail with `Illegal instruction` errors and the bot will not start. See the known issues section below.

## 🖥️ System Requirements & Prerequisites

| Component     | Minimum                        | Recommended                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| CPU           | x86 with AVX support (2011+)   | Modern quad-core or better       |
| Memory        | 1 GB free RAM                  | 2+ GB for smoother operation     |

*   An existing, functional installation of the [Whiteout Survival Discord Bot](https://github.com/Reloisback/Whiteout-Survival-Discord-Bot).
*   Access to the server or machine where the bot is running.
*   Ability to download files and copy them into the bot's directory.
*   Python and pip installed on the system running the bot (should be already if the bot is working).

---

## Installation Steps

1.  **🛑 STOP THE BOT:** Ensure your Discord bot `main.py` script is not currently running.

2.  **🛡️ Backup Your Database:**
    *   Navigate to your bot's main directory.
    *   Locate the `db` folder.
    *   **COPY** (do **NOT** move) the entire `db` folder to a safe location outside of the bot's directory. This backup contains your user data, alliance settings, gift codes, etc. and can be restored in case you ever need to revert to the original code.

3.  **💾 Backup Existing Code (Recommended):**
    *   It's also wise to back up the specific Python files you are about to replace. Copy the following files from your current bot installation to your backup location:
        *   `main.py`
        *   `cogs/gift_operations.py`

4.  **⬇️ Download Patch Files:**
    *   Download the updated Python files for the CAPTCHA patch. You will need these specific files:
        *   `main.py`
        *   `cogs/gift_operations.py`
        *   `cogs/gift_captchasolver.py` (This is a new file)
    *   [Click here to download Patch Files](https://github.com/justncodes/Whiteout-Survival-Discord-Bot/releases/download/v1.0.0/1.0.0-Gift-Code-OCR.zip)

5.  **🔄 Replace/Add Files:**
    *   Go to your bot's main directory.
    *   Replace the existing `main.py` with the downloaded `main.py`.
    *   Go into the `cogs` sub-directory.
    *   Replace the existing `gift_operations.py` with the downloaded one.
    *   Add the new `gift_captchasolver.py` file into the `cogs` directory.

6.  **⚙️ Install Dependencies:**
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt **in your bot's main directory**.
    *   Run the bot's startup command as you normally would (e.g., `python main.py`).
    *   Observe the console output. The script should detect missing libraries (especially PyTorch and EasyOCR) and attempt to install them. This step might take several minutes, especially for PyTorch, depending on your internet connection.
    *   **If the automatic installation fails:** You may need to install them manually. The most common command would be:
        ```bash
        pip install easyocr torch torchvision torchaudio opencv-python pillow numpy PyYAML scipy
        ```
        *(Note: For CPU-only systems, PyTorch should ideally be installed using the specific CPU index URL as handled by the updated `main.py`. If manual install is needed, refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the correct CPU-only install command for your OS.)*

7.  **▶️ Restart the Bot:**
    *   If the dependency installation required a manual step, run the bot startup command again (e.g., `python main.py`).
    *   If the automatic installation in step 6 completed successfully, the bot should continue starting up.

8.  **✅ Verify:**
    *   Check the bot's console output for any errors during startup, especially related to `GiftOperations` or `GiftCaptchaSolver`. Look for messages indicating whether the solver initialized successfully (and if it's using CPU or GPU).
    *   Once the bot is online, try using the `/settings` command (or equivalent) and navigate to the Gift Code Operations menu to ensure it loads correctly.
    *   Test redeeming some gift codes. It should be working, although it may take longer than before.

## 🧹 Post-Installation

*   The CAPTCHA solver should now be active (using CPU by default). It has approximately 70% accuracy at the moment. Improvements are being worked on, but it works for now.
*   In case any IDs end up with an Error result, you can always re-run the redemption for the same gift code and alliance again to hopefully redeem it successfully this time.
*   You can configure GPU usage (if available and desired) and other OCR settings via the bot's `/settings` -> Gift Code Operations -> CAPTCHA Settings menu.
*   You can monitor the bot's logs (`log/giftlog.txt` and `log/gift_ops.log`) for CAPTCHA-related messages during gift code processing.

## 🛠️ Patch Notes – Version 1.0.5

- ✅ Improved CAPTCHA handling:
  - The gift code redemption process no longer fails when a `CAPTCHA_INVALID` response is received.
  - OCR is now retried up to **4 times** before giving up, increasing the success rate.
  - Progress of captcha attempts is now reflected in the Discord embed during gift code creation.
  
- ♻️ Improved robustness of the gift code channel monitoring:
  - If 4 redemption attempts fail, a ⏳ emoji is added, and the system retries in the next cycle.

- 🧹 Bug Fixes & Maintenance:
  - Fixed an error when saving all OCR images (previously required turning off image saving to avoid crash).
  - Reduced frequency of periodic gift code revalidation from every 5 minutes to **every 30 minutes** to reduce system load.
  - Final status update in the result embed is now always shown after redemption completes.
  - Switched `giftlog.txt` to use a proper logger with **log rotation** (3MB max, 3 backups).
  - Gift Code Operations menu text was updated to cover all buttons.

- 🧠 OCR and image processing improvements:
  - Decoupled image saving from OCR outcome: captcha images are saved once up front and renamed/deleted later based on result.
  - Captcha images from successful OCR are now saved as `<captcha>.png`.
  - Failed OCR attempts are saved (if enabled) as `FAIL_<captcha>_<timestamp>.png`.

## 🐛 Known Issue: Crash on Startup (CPU Incompatibility)

```
[W502 21:55:47.413693709 NNPACK.cpp:57] Could not initialize NNPACK! Reason: Unsupported hardware.
Illegal instruction
```

This occurs on CPUs that **lack AVX or AVX2 instruction support** (common in CPUs before 2011). PyTorch requires these instruction sets. This is not a bug in the bot, but a limitation of PyTorch.

📌 **Workaround (in progress):**
We're exploring lighter alternatives to EasyOCR and PyTorch for users on older hardware. A solution will be published in a future patch.
